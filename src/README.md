## Guidelines

### .NET Interactive
Sometimes we rely on [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) to
research ideas. Its notebooks are isolated from the build process itself, so won't
interfere with projects packages, sources, existing namings etc. But at the same time
can be placed side by side with existing code. .NET Interactive is supported by
extensions in VSCode and Visual Studio.

Another advantage is rich documentation possibilities. Notebook can look like a research
paper with executable code islands there.
