# XDE Team Server

Development of this application was triggered by a lack of good project/task/resource/etc
management tool for big non-commercial organizations. Most of "free" software on the
market became very pricey when team becomes more than 10+ users.

Also there were some other missing features, especially related to the resource
management and AI team members.

The best way to develop a good application is to use it constantly. So initially it is
developed as a main too for https://xde.team.

## Guidelines

### .NET Interactive
Sometimes we rely on [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) to
research ideas. Its notebooks are isolated from the build process itself, so won't
interfere with projects packages, sources, existing namings etc. But at the same time
can be placed side by side with existing code. .NET Interactive is supported by
extensions in VSCode and Visual Studio.

Another advantage is rich documentation possibilities. Notebook can look like a research
paper with executable code islands there.
