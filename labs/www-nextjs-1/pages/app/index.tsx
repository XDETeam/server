        <h2>Must-have tool for engineers</h2>

        <p>
            Product has many aspects (TODO:reference to aspect-oriented
            approach). This is not a question of its design only, but also
            project management, change management, communications and many other
            duties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of this specific tools are surprisingly similar (TODO:e.g.
            samples of hierarchically organized "explorers" in Visual Studio,
            Blender, GMail, Confluence, YouTrack and others, "property editors",
            etc), but they are ridiculously disconnected.
        </p>

        <p>
            SDE App is a more comprehensive engineering tool based on a
            fundamental concepts (TODO:references). We expect it can be used by
            anyone, no matter what kind of goods you craft.
